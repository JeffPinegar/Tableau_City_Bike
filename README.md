<h3>1_City_bike 2022_combine_csv_1Prct.ipynb</h3>
Extract and transform the 2022 Citi Bike data for complete details see “The Story.” Essentially the analysis is performed on 1% of the 2022 data from Citi Bike. 
<h3>2_Stations_location.ipynb</h3>
The data set did not include location information for the stations.  The longitude and latitude data in the data set is for the bike.  Bike data was averaged to define station location information.
<h3>3_Filter_0utliers.ipynb</h3>
Filtered out rides less than 1 min and greater than 24 hours.  See “The Story” for more information
